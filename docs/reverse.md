## Introduction

Welcome to my write-ups for the Reverse Engineering section of the 2025 picoCTF challenge. Reverse Engineering is a fascinating aspect of the cybersecurity field that is beyond the scope of this write to fully cover. GeekforGeeks does a good job [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-reverse-engineering-technique-in-cybersecurity/). Essentially, it is taking something apart to discover what it does. <br/>
This CTF is divided into six categories; [Web Exploitation](./webexploit.md), [Cryptography](./cryptography.md), [Reverse Engineering](./reverse.md), [Forensics](./forensics.md), [General Skills](./general.md), and [Binary Exploitation](./binary.md). You can follow the links to the other categories or the links below to the challenges I was able to complete before the end of the competition.<br/>

??? tip "Navigation tip"
    Depending on the write up, there can be quite a bit of information to read through. To make things a little easier, you can use ++"P"++ or ++","++ to go to the previous section, ++"N"++ or ++"."++ to navigate to the next section, and ++"S"++, ++"F"++, or ++"/"++ to open up the search dialog.

    **TL;DR** if you keep pressing ++"N"++ or ++"."++ from this point forward, you'll hit all the content in the right order! :smile:

!!! success "1. Flag Hunters - :fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-regular-star::fontawesome-regular-star::fontawesome-regular-star::fontawesome-regular-star:"
    Find the correct [injection](./Reverse Engineering/o1.md) to view the secret lyrics.

!!! success "2. Binary Instrumentation 1 - :fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-regular-star::fontawesome-regular-star::fontawesome-regular-star:"
    Use the Frida tool to find and interact with [functions](./Reverse Engineering/o2.md) to trigger the flag.

!!! success "3. Tap into Hash - :fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-regular-star::fontawesome-regular-star::fontawesome-regular-star:"
    Reverse Engineer the [block chain](./Reverse Engineering/o3.md) to decrypt the flag.
