# Web Exploitation (2500 possible points)

![Overview](./img/misc/pico.png)

## Introduction

This is the Web Exploitation category. As seen, there were a total of 11 challenges worth up to 2500 total points. I was able to complete six of the challenges.

    Depending on the write up, there can be quite a bit of information to read through. To make things a little easier, you can use ++"P"++ or ++","++ to go to the previous section, ++"N"++ or ++"."++ to navigate to the next section, and ++"S"++, ++"F"++, or ++"/"++ to open up the search dialog.

    **TL;DR** if you keep pressing ++"N"++ or ++"."++ from this point forward, you'll hit all the content in the right order! :smile:

    Using the tools from the last challenge, [bypass](./WebExploitation/o5.md) the filters put in place to retrieve the flag.

## Conclusion

That is the extent of the Web Exploitation Category that I was able to complete during the competition. There were other challenges that I look forward to completing eventually. Web Exploitation was the largest of the categories in the picoCTF challenge, which seems appropriate given the vastness of the topic.I'll be adding other write-ups to this as I am able to complete them.
