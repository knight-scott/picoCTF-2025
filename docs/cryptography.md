# Welcome

![Group photo](./img/misc/crypto_image.png) Welcome to my write-ups for the 2025 picoCTF Cryptography category. I was able to complete three of the six challenges during the challenge window and document them in the following walk-throughs.<br/>
This CTF is divided into six categories; [Web Exploitation](./webexploit.md), [Cryptography](./cryptography.md), [Reverse Engineering](./reverse.md), [Forensics](./forensics.md), [General Skills](./general.md), and [Binary Exploitation](./binary.md). You can follow the links to the other categories or the links below to the challenges I was able to complete before the end of the competition.<br/>

??? tip "Navigation tip"
    Depending on the write up, there can be quite a bit of information to read through. To make things a little easier, you can use ++"P"++ or ++","++ to go to the previous section, ++"N"++ or ++"."++ to navigate to the next section, and ++"S"++, ++"F"++, or ++"/"++ to open up the search dialog.

    **TL;DR** if you keep pressing ++"N"++ or ++"."++ from this point forward, you'll hit all the content in the right order! :smile:
