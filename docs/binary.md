## Introduction

Welcome to the Binary Exploitation section of the write-up. This category practices using just the binary to work around or overcome security features.<br/>
This CTF is divided into six categories; [Web Exploitation](./webexploit.md), [Cryptography](./cryptography.md), [Reverse Engineering](./reverse.md), [Forensics](./forensics.md), [General Skills](./general.md), and [Binary Exploitation](./binary.md). You can follow the links to the other categories or the links below to the challenges I was able to complete before the end of the competition.<br/>

??? tip "Navigation tip"
    Depending on the write up, there can be quite a bit of information to read through. To make things a little easier, you can use ++"P"++ or ++","++ to go to the previous section, ++"N"++ or ++"."++ to navigate to the next section, and ++"S"++, ++"F"++, or ++"/"++ to open up the search dialog.

    **TL;DR** if you keep pressing ++"N"++ or ++"."++ from this point forward, you'll hit all the content in the right order! :smile:

!!! success "1. PIE TIME- :fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-regular-star::fontawesome-regular-star::fontawesome-regular-star::fontawesome-regular-star:"
    Find the local offset and [overcome](./Binary Exploitation/o1.md) the security feature.

!!! success "2. hash-only-1 - :fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-regular-star::fontawesome-regular-star::fontawesome-regular-star:"
    Use [Command Injection](./Binary Exploitation/o2.md) to retrieve the flag.

!!! success "3. hash-only-2 - :fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-regular-star::fontawesome-regular-star:"
    Using `scp` to upload [command injection](./Binary Exploitation/o3.md) exploitation.

## Conclusion

These challenges were unique in my experiences with CTFs so far and I look forward to exploring the category further with the picoCTF practice gym.
