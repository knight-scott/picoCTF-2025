# SSTI2

**Difficulty**: :fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-regular-star::fontawesome-regular-star::fontawesome-regular-star:<br/>
**Direct link**: [Objective5.zip](https://.../)

## Objective

!!! question "Request"
    I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! I read about input sanitization, so now I remove any kind of characters that could be a problem <br/>
    I heard templating is a cool and modular way to build web apps! Check out my website <br/>

## Hints

??? tip "Hint 1"
    Server Side Template Injection

??? tip "Insert Hint 2 Title"
    Why is blacklisting characters a bad idea to sanitize input?

## Solution

This challange is the same in regard to the technology used and attack surface as [SSTI 1](./o4.md) challenge. We have the same input field, but as the creator of the challenge has warned us, our simple attacks from earlier will no longer work.

Because the characters we need to make this work seem to be blacklisted, we will have to find ways around that. This highlights one of the primary flaws with 'blacklisting'; there are often bypass techniques that are easy to find. Going back to **PayloadsAllTheThings** I was able to find [payloads](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Server%20Side%20Template%20Injection/Python.md) meant to bypass various filters within the same page that we found the payload for [SSTI 1](./o4.md). Using Intruder in BurpSuite Community, I copied each of the payloads to test for the one that returned the appropriate response. Once that was determined, I adjusted the payload to contain `cat flag` as the executed command, coppied the payload to Repeater in BurpSuite, and now we have our next flag! 

!!! success "Answer"
    Using tools such as BurpSuite Community and PayloadsAllTheThings, by pass the input filters to retrieve tha flag.
